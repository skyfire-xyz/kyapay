# Scope

We have released the core token data and a set of example APIs in this 
repository to invite early feedback from the community. This release is intended
as a starting point and serves to gather input, validate design decisions, and
assess interest in forming or joining a formal Working Group.

The Working Group will steward the development of the full **v1.0 specification**,
and its scope of work will be clearly defined upon that release. We welcome
participation from developers, protocol designers, infrastructure providers, and
other stakeholders interested in shaping a shared identity and transaction layer
for agentic AI.
