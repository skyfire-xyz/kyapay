This repository contains the source content for the KYAPay open specification. 
It currently includes the core token structure and a set of example APIs of 
KYAPay, an identity-linked payment protocol for agent-to-agent and 
agent-to-service interactions using JWT tokens. The full specification v1.0 of 
KYAPay is aimed to be released soon in this repo.

We are in active conversations with partners and ecosystem stakeholders about 
collaboratively developing the KYAPay Protocol. Once the Working Group is 
officially formed, more details will be released.
