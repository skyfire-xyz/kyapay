# KYAPay Protocol (kyapay.org)

This repository contains the source content for the KYAPay open protocol. 
It currently includes the core token structure and a set of example APIs of 
KYAPay, an identity-linked payment protocol for agent-to-agent and 
agent-to-service interactions using JWT tokens. The full specification v1.0 of 
KYAPay is aimed to be released soon in this repo.

* The [Example API](https://github.com/skyfire-xyz/kyapay/blob/main/docs/example-api.md)

* This work is being conducted under the 
  [Community Specification License v1.0](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-spec/blob/main/1._Community_Specification_License-v1.md)

We are in active conversations with partners and ecosystem stakeholders about 
collaboratively developing the KYAPay Protocol. Once the Working Group is 
officially formed, more details will be released.
