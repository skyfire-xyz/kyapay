# Community Specification Governance Policy 1.0

This project currently uses a provisional governance model.

- Changes to the specification must be proposed via pull request.
- The original authors will review and approve changes until a broader governance process is defined.
- We intend to adopt a more formal governance process as community involvement grows.
